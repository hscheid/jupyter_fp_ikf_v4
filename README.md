# jupyter_fp_ikf_v4
Jupiter notebook to analyse the recorded data in the student lab course of the institute of nuclear physics of the Goethe University in Frankfurt.
There is a notebook written in c++ and uses the ROOT framework for data analysis, this however requires a root installation.
Another notebook written in python using the `scipy` and `numpy` modules can also be found. This runs on binder and can be found here: [link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hscheid/jupyter_fp_ikf_v4/aac92eea9ffd0e121910849676baf80a8d52a87e?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fcode%2FAnalysis_part3_py.ipynb)
