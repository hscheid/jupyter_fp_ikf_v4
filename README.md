# jupyter_fp_ikf_v4
Jupiter notebook to analyse the recorded data in the student lab course of the institute of nuclear physics of the Goethe University in Frankfurt.
There is a notebook written in c++ and uses the ROOT framework for data analysis, this however requires a root installation.
Another notebook written in python using the `scipy` and `numpy` modules can also be found. This runs on binder and can be found here:
